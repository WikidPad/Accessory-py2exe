This is a modified version of py2exe 0.6.9

Modified by: Michael Butscher <mbutscher@gmx.de>
Modified for: WikidPad (http://wikidpad.sourceforge.net)
Modifications:

- Additional option "exeoptimize" which controls the optimization level
  with which the Python interpreter in the .exe file is started. The
  option allows to set it differently from the optimization level
  with which the files in "library.zip" were created (option "optimize").
  This was needed to ensure that plugins (which are not compiled during
  py2exe run) keep their doc-strings which allows to use some special parser
  in some third-party plugins.

- Faster processing of Python bytecode because large bytecode files like
  one generated by comtypes (3,37 MiBytes!) are too slow with the original
  code.


This archive doesn't contain a "setup.py" file. Just place the archive content
into a directory "py2exe" in "Lib\site-packages" below the Python installation
directory.
